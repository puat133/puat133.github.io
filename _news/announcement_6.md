PhD Opportunities in Control Theory, Robotics, and Applied Mathematics

Dr. Emzir's research group at KFUPM is inviting applications for highly qualified PhD students to participate in advanced research at the intersection of control theory, differential geometry, robotics, and computational methods. Candidates with strong backgrounds in control systems, computer science, physics, mathematics, or closely related fields are encouraged to apply.

**Available Research Topics**

    1.    Differential geometry–based state-estimation and control design
    2.    Koopman operator formalism for feedback control design in robotics and prosthetic systems

**About the Research Group**

Dr. Emzir's group focuses on rigorous and foundational approaches to modern control and estimation, bridging theoretical developments with practical implementations in robotics and autonomous systems. Additional information about the group and its current research can be found here:
