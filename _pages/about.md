Muhammad F. Emzir is currently an assistant professor at Control and Instrumentation Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. He received a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 2018 from the University of New South Wales. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science (2018), and at Aalto University (2018â€“2021). His main research interests are in quantum control, nonlinear control, and stochastic filtering.

I am always open for research collaborations, especially about quantum filtering and control, or general stochastic filtering. 
Currently, I am looking for a PhD student that can work with me for a project about numerical implementation of projection filter.
