I am presently an assistant professor at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals' Control and Instrumentation Engineering Department. In 2018, I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of New South Wales. Following the completion of my PhD, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science (2018) and Aalto University (2018â€“2021). My areas of research include quantum control, nonlinear control, and stochastic filtering.

I am always interested in collaborating on research projects, particularly those involving quantum filtering and control or generic stochastic filtering.
I am now searching for a PhD student to collaborate with me on a project involving the numerical implementation of a projection filter.
