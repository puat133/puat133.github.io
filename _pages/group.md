### Collaboration Opportunities

We are always interested in collaborating on research projects, particularly those involving:
- Nonlinear control systems via Koopman operator theory and differential geometry
- Bayesian inference and Gaussian processes
- Quantum filtering and control
- Stochastic filtering and estimation
- Sensor fusion and SLAM

If you are interested in joining the group or collaborating, please contact Dr. Emzir at [muhammad.emzir@gmail.com](mailto:muhammad.emzir@gmail.com).
