  abstract={We provide a rigorous derivation of a quantum filter for the case of multiple measurements being made on a quantum system. We consider a class of measurement processes which are functions of bosonic field operators, including combinations of diffusive and Poissonian processes. This covers the standard cases from quantum optics, where homodyne detection may be described as a diffusive process and photon counting may be described as a Poissonian process. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for any pair of such measurements taken at different output channels to satisfy a commutation relationship. Then, we derive a general, multiple-measurement quantum filter as an extension of a single-measurement quantum filter. As an application we explicitly obtain the quantum filter corresponding to homodyne detection and photon counting at the output ports of a beam splitter.},

  abstract={In this article, we propose a Lyapunov stability approach to analyze the convergence of the density operator of a quantum system. In contrast to many previously studied convergence analysis methods for invariant density operators which use weak convergence, in this article we analyze the convergence of density operators by considering the set of density operators as a Banach space. We show that the set of invariant density operators is both closed and convex, which implies the impossibility of having multiple isolated invariant density operators. We then show how to analyze the stability of this set via a candidate Lyapunov operator.},

  abstract={In this article, we study Bayesian inverse problems with multi-layered Gaussian priors. The aim of the multi-layered hierarchical prior is to provide enough complexity structure to allow for both smoothing and edge-preserving properties at the same time. We first describe the conditionally Gaussian layers in terms of a system of stochastic partial differential equations. We then build the computational inference method using a finite-dimensional Galerkin method. We show that the proposed approximation has a convergence-in-probability property to the solution of the original multi-layered model. We then carry out Bayesian inference using the preconditioned Crank\textendash Nicolson algorithm which is modified to work with multi-layered Gaussian fields. We show via numerical experiments in signal deconvolution and computerized x-ray tomography problems that the proposed method can offer both smoothing and edge preservation at the same time.},

  title={Multidimensional {{Projection Filters}} via {{Automatic Differentiation}} and {{Sparse-Grid Integration}}},
  author={Emzir, Muhammad and Zhao, Zheng and S{\"a}rkk{\"a}, Simo},
  year={2021},
  journal={ArXiv},
  abstract={The projection filter is a method for approximating the dynamics of conditional probability densities of optimal filtering problems. In projection filters, the Kushner--Stratonovich stochastic partial differential equation governing the evolution of the optimal filtering density is projected to a manifold of parametric densities, yielding a finite-dimensional stochastic differential equation. Despite its capability of capturing complex probability densities, the implementations of projection filters are (so far) restricted to either the Gaussian family or unidimensional filtering problems. This paper considers a combination of numerical integration and automatic differentiation to construct projection filters for more general problems. We give a detailed exposition about this combination for the manifold of the exponential family. We show via numerical experiments that this approach can maintain a fairly accurate approximation of the filtering density compared to the finite-difference based Zakai filter and a particle filter while requiring a relatively low number of quadrature points.},

  author={Emzir, Muhammad Fuady and Zhao, Zheng and Cheded, Lahouari and S{\"a}rkk{\"a}, Simo},
  year={2023},
  abstract={The automatic projection filter is a novel approach for solving the projection filter that makes use of sparse-grid integration and automatic differentiation. However, its quality is highly dependent on the accuracy of the calculation of the cumulant-generating function via sparse-grid integration.     In this article, we provide two new parametric bijections for the automatic projection filter using the exponential family based on the Gaussian family. The first method relies on the minimization of Kullback-Leibler divergence, whereas the second method employs the Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula. These bijections let the sparse-grid nodes to move adaptively about the high-density domain, resulting in a substantially more accurate approximation while using a small number of quadrature nodes.      The proposed approaches produce satisfactory results when compared to those based on the use of the finite difference approximation     of the Kushner--Stratonovich equation or of the particle filter empirical density.}
